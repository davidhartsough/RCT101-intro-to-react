# RCT101 Introduction to React

Welcome to your first course in React. Strap in and hold your hats. Please keep your hands inside the lessons at all times. 

Inside this course are 10 lessons, each building upon the last, right up to a grand finale, so you'll want to take this one lesson at a time from 1 to 10. By the end, you'll understand React, JSX, Components, Props, State, Styling, Lifecycles, Data, and Containers. But at the beginning, it is only assumed that you are familiar with JavaScript.

Each lesson has its own directory with a `README.md` file inside that will serve as your guideâ€”your instructions. The README.md files generally follow a format in which it will introduce a new concept, define it, explain what it is, explain its purpose and why its useful, walk you through how to use it with some hands-on activities, challenge you to take it to the next level, ask you five review questions, and finally offer you references (external links) for further investigation. 

Next to each README.md file is an `index.html` file that will serve as your sandbox and playground. Simply open the file in your browser to see your work at work. While these index.html files are provided for you, it is highly recommended that you create a separate index.html file on your own and open it in your favorite text editor. That way you can always have the same file open in your text editor and in your browser, *and* you'll be writing everything from scratch! Those of you who achieve this will be awarded a React sticker and much praise. 

Thank you for choosing RCT101. Enjoy the ride.
